# Relationship Extraction Application using RoBERTa and Sentiment Analysis Datasets
## Introduction
This project aims to develop an application that utilizes RoBERTa, a variant of BERT, for relationship extraction in text data. The application focuses on extracting interpersonal relationships from input sentences. It utilizes sentiment analysis datasets for training and employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for accurate relationship extraction.

## Technologies Used
- Linux: Ubuntu or any Linux distribution for development environment.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for implementing and training RoBERTa models.
- SwiftUI: Framework for building the user interface of the application.
- Data Preprocessing Library: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, or Scikit-learn for data preprocessing tasks.
## Features
- Utilizes RoBERTa model for relationship extraction in input sentences.
- Supports various types of relationships extraction including familial, professional, and personal relationships.
- Provides interactive user interface designed with SwiftUI for ease of use.
- Offers seamless integration with sentiment analysis datasets for model training and evaluation.

##Acknowledgements
- Special thanks to the creators and contributors of RoBERTa and TensorFlow.
- We acknowledge the providers of sentiment analysis datasets for their valuable resources.
- We appreciate the open-source community for their continuous support and contributions.
